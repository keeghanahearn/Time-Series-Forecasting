Time series analysis that uses electric car sales and commuter bus ridership to forecast Toyota Camry sales in the US. I create and analyze several plots, including seasonal plots. I use a training and test set to identify the best model to forecast sales. Fitted models to the training set of models to identify the best ARIMA model in terms of accuracy and residuals that were homoscedastic.
